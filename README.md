# Waving Politely

This project is being used to showcase some ideas I have for waveforms to be used in future synthesizer projects and is also being made with the hope that it'll make my life easier down the road.

## How to use

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. Open the JavaScript file (`script.js`) in a code editor and modify the values of `f` and `a` to change the frequency and amplitude of the sine wave, respectively.
3. Save the changes to `script.js` and refresh the page in the browser to see the updated art.

## Limitations

- The code assumes a canvas with an ID of `myCanvas` is present on the page. You can modify the code to target a different canvas if needed.
- The code uses the `hsl()` function to generate a color gradient based on the sine wave value. You can modify the code to use a different color scheme if desired.
